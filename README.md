this is an realtime chat website that i am making as something to do that allows users to make an account and then login and view a blog that gets saved and one on one chats and group chats

all the install you need to run the website on your machine
npm install dotenv express http ws path bcrypt express-session connect-mongo express-ws multer

to get this to work also make an file called .env and have this in it SESSION_SECRET='relace with random string between 15 to 25'<br>
MONGO_URL='mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/your databases name'<br>
and also you this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB6WLkSrtJk video to get a mongodb database working and then you can make you database and call it what you decide earlier in the mongo_url

also to run open the terminal and run node app.js
not adding any more and what is there is what is there
